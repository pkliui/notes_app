The application allows users to add, modify and delete daily notes through a web interface


- **Frontend**: Built with **TypeScript** and **React**, providing an interactive UI.

- **Backend**: Developed with **TypeScript** and **Node.js**. **Prisma** acts as the ORM to interact with the database, and the **Express** library is used to set up the API endpoints.

- **Database**: Notes are stored in a **PostgreSQL** database hosted by **Neon.tech**.

- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu** instance using **Docker** containers.

- **Nginx** is set up both to route traffic to the appropriate services and to serve the static files for the React app.

- **CI/CD**: Managed via **GitHub Actions**
